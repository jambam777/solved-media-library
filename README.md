·         –  Number of times the song has been playedPlaylist (consisting of the following properties/attributes)·         –  Name of the playlist

·         –  The date the playlist was created (should be automatically generated from the actual current date)

·         –  Collection of songs on the playlist

Playlist need the following functionality:·         –  The ability to add song to playlist

·         –  The ability to display the contents of the playlist

7.    Browse a playlist sorted by title, artist, year, and number of times played
